    <h1>Professional Background |</h1>
    <h2>From 1997 until 2012 I worked as R&D Electronic Engineer in Electronica Integral de Sonido (Eissound).</h2>

    <h2>In March 2012 I&nbsp;changed my professional carreer and started working as Industrial Manager at the same company being in charge of the Production, Purchasing and Quality departments.</h2>

      <p>During my first stage as R&D Enginner I gained a broad experience programming ST, Motorola, Freescale, NXP and Microchip micro-controllers using different languages; I also gained a deep insight designing PCBs with Protel.</p>
      <p>Next step was designing electric schemes, being reposible for selecting the most critical components in different developments.&nbsp; It was a must to be up-to-date with a lot of new technologies to avoid becoming quickly obsoletes and ahead of our competitors.</p>
      <p>My last stage as an R&D Engineer was being in charge of several developments, being also reponsable for the safety, radio frequency and electromagnetic compatibility tests to obtain all required CE, UL and FCC certifications.</p>
      <p>Along these 15 years I had the opportunity of working in a wide range of electronic applications like audio players, FM tuners, power supplies, radio frequency modules, batteries' chargers and much more auxiliary devices.&nbsp; It was an exciting period, fascinating and creative indeed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_explanation" id="second_exp_txt_div">
      <p>In 2012 Electronica Integral de Sonido offered to me a vacant position as Industrial Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a professional challenge and also a new opportunity and I soon accepted.</p>
      <p>My current tasks are the selection, negotiation and supervision of our local and foreign suppliers, being a key mission dealing with our suppliers in China. It is also very important to forecast production charges and coordinate them with purchase orders. All that without forgetting the quality department, essential to reach the requirements of our customers.</p>
      <p>Last but not least, the most difficult and enriching task: to lead a human team of ten persons, keeping them focused and motivated.</p>
      <p>Main characteristics of this new professional stage is the intensity and responsability this position carries.  It also provides a wider and more global point of view of how a company runs.</p>
